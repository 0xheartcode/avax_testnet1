# 0x<3 SOLIDITY GRIMOIRE

## Spellbook for young and old magicians, from easy to intermediate solidity spells.



This book can be read in a specific order (note the numbers 0>1>2) or can simply be browsed for spell snippets. 

This was an old repo that the author brought back from the ether to be: part learning tool, part portfolio, part archive.
